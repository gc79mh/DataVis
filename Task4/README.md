Create an interactive data analysis dashboard:

* Select an application domain and source dataset(s)
* Define a set of tasks to be accomplished using your dashboard
* Create a pen and pencil sketch of the dashboard
* Create a repository
* Implement the dashboard
* Submit a short dashboard description, sketches, github address, and a link to a live demo of the dashboard


Expected elements:
* logo or monogram
* clean, elegant theme and/or custom CSS
* about and/or help section
* at least six interactive visualization components
* each visualization component should react to user input through a control widget
* at least one of the components should be a datatable
* at least one visualization component should offer a select interaction that triggers a change in another component (e.g. selecting a row in a movie datatable shows its review; clicking on a point on an actor scatter plot shows his/her headshot, brushing in a multiform view)
* tabs, pills, or multi-page view to separate different groups of components
* the dashboard should be dynamic (use a server)
