This is a student project

**Create a reproducible report of an exploratory data analysis with several visualizations:**

1. Download the data from the course website
2. Choose a subset of the attributes in the datasets and analyze that portion of the data
3. Prepare a reproducible, standalone HTML report in R or Python containing at least 6 visualizations


Expected elements:

* university logo or monogram (https://www.put.poznan.pl/siw; probably 01_ or 03_ or 06_)
* clean, elegant theme and/or custom CSS
* interactive (i.e. with links) table of contents
* executive summary
* six or more high-quality, cohesive visualizations (think about the consistent use of color, select appropriate palettes, avoid chart clutter, try to show data variation, try to tell a story if you find interesting patterns, don't rely on plotting library defaults if something can be improved)
* short description of each visualization
* optionally some description of your findings
* where appropriate, use animations or javascript-based plots to add some interactivity
* the report should be a standalone document; no server, no external resources, no accompanying folders
* Your focus is to create engaging, high-quality plots
